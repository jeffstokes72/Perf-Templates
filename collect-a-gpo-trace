Using XPERF to capture slow logons
1.	Logon as an Administrator of the computer you want to trace (either a local Administrator or Domain Admin account that is a member of the local machine's Administrators group).
2.	Open an elevated command prompt and run this command from WPT Install directory (default path is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Windows Performance Toolkit. 
xperf -on base+latency+dispatcher+NetworkTrace+Registry+FileIO -stackWalk CSwitch+ReadyThread+ThreadCreate+Profile -BufferSize 256 -start UserTrace -on "Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Core+Microsoft-Windows-Wininit+Microsoft-Windows-Folder Redirection+Microsoft-Windows-User Profiles Service+Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy+Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon+Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos+Microsoft-Windows-User Profiles General+e5ba83f6-07d0-46b1-8bc7-7e669a1d31dc+63b530f8-29c9-4880-a5b4-b8179096e7b8+2f07e2ee-15db-40f1-90ef-9d7ba282188a"  -BufferSize 1024 -MinBuffers 512 -MaxBuffers 1024 -MaxFile 4096
Note: This syntax works on Windows Vista (Windows Server 2008) and Windows 7 (Windows Server 2008 R2) computers
3.	Press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then Switch User.
4.	Logon with the user account experiencing the slow user logon to reproduce the issue.
5.	Stop the trace. While logged on with the slow user account, open an elevated CMD prompt and type:   
xperf -stop -stop UserTrace -d merged.etl
Close the slow logon user session and the admin logon session opened in step 2 as required.
IMPORTANT: The double “-stop” call in step 5 is not a typo but is required. The first "-stop" terminates kernel tracing. The second "-stop" terminates user mode tracing. Trust us.
Note: You can also stop the trace by using Switch User to return to the admin user logon established in step #2 and running the same XPERF stop command in the elevated command prompt used to start the trace. This results in a larger, longer trace and requires that you discern the different logons encapsulated in the trace. 
6.	Send the MERGED.ETL file to Microsoft or an Independent Solution Vendor (ISV) for analysis, or review it yourself.
By default, the MERGED.ETL file will exist in the XPERF installation directory, which by default is %systemdrive%\program files\microsoft windows performance toolkit directory or if you followed our recommendations early in the doc, the c:\XPERF directory (that is, the XPERF installation directory).
 Optional: Follow KB 315231   to enable automatic logon.
